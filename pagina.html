<p> New brand founded by 4 young creative students!Nobody likes mondays, except us!
	Today is a milestone in the history of BLASĒ because our first stock of sweatshirts and
	bombers has arrived! We are extremely excited and hope that you are too! Keep an eye on our
	instagram and be one of the first proud owners of an official BLASĒ sweatshirt!
Everyone wants to go with the times, but time changes. And fashion changes as well.
And along with the fashion people and their idols, consciousness and life itself change.
Fashion has (and has always had) an incredible impact on the lifestyle of modern women.
Every women want to dress in a good taste, but not all of them are able to do so.
 There are women who are on the peak of fashion, but there are those who are trying
 to get used to fashion gradually, and by this time it becomes obsolete.
But with a BLASĒ sweatshirt you're always perfect dressed!</p>
